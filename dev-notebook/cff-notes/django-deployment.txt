Django currently supports two interfaces: WSGI and ASGI.
- WSGI is the main Python standard for communicating between web servers and applications, but it only supports synchronous code.
- ASGI is the new, asynchronous-friendly standard that will allow your Django site to use asynchronous Python features, and asynchronous Django features as they are developed.

You should also consider how you will handle static files for your application, and how to handle error reporting.

Waitress = WSGI server
Nginx

However, if you want to host on Siteground, the basic premise would be to get Django running through a WSGI or ASGI server, which is then fronted by Apache or NGINX. My preferred setup, in this case, would be using (waitress)[https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/] as a WSGI server then use NGINX to front the server. You would then need to configure NGINX to manage SSL termination, possibly configure static and media files and other HTTP headers.

Let me know if you have any further questions and I can dig out more details.
